### Hello!

I'm Spencer Wilson, a data scientist and alumni of BYU. I'm working on a variety of things; I have projects involving data science, computer science, and game development. I use mainly Python and Java, but I also know R and C++. I like to tinker with my computer and hope not to break anything!
